# AI Traffic Light System for Ambulance Detection

## Overview

This project aims to enhance traffic light systems using AI to detect ambulances in real-time and prioritize their movement by changing traffic signals to green. The system uses a custom-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify ambulances and then interacts with traffic light control mechanisms to provide a clear path for the emergency vehicle.

## Features

- **Real-time Ambulance Detection**: Uses a pre-trained YOLO model to detect ambulances from live camera feeds.
- **Traffic Light Control**: Automatically changes traffic signals to green when an ambulance is detected.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Provides a web-based interface for monitoring and controlling the system.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to integrate with existing traffic management systems.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Required Libraries

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install streamlit opencv-python-headless numpy
```

### YOLO Files

Download the YOLO model configuration and weights files:

- [YOLOv3 Weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
- [YOLOv3 Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)
- [COCO Names](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pjreddie/darknet/master/data/coco.names)

Place these files in the project directory.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Streamlit Interface**:
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to access the interface.

3. **Start Detection**:
   Check the "Run" checkbox in the Streamlit interface to start the live camera feed and begin detecting ambulances.

## How It Works

- The system captures video from the laptop's camera.
- Frames are processed using the YOLO model to detect ambulances.
- If an ambulance is detected, the system triggers a function to change the traffic lights to green, allowing the ambulance to pass through.

## Custom YOLO Model

To detect ambulances specifically, a custom-trained YOLO model is used. You can train your own model by following these steps:

1. Collect and label a dataset of ambulance images.
2. Train the YOLO model using a framework like Darknet, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
3. Replace the YOLO files in the project directory with your custom-trained model.
